# tesla-website

Technologies used:
-HTML;
-CSS;

What I have achieved with this project:
-Getting more comfortable working with CSS and HTML by replicating an existing website design;
-Using "Google.fonts" to modify text so it has a desirable shape;

What the project could have perhaps:
-A JavaScript file so the Menu "button" would allow the user to interact with it;
-A second JavaScript file so the page would have smooth scroll implemmented. For example, once there was a click on the cars models, the page would take the user smoothly to the desired section;


Stages of the project:
1- Getting the "Tesla" logo as well as the desired color reference code by inspecting the actual "tesla.com" html and css files;
2- Getting the top bar with car models sorted;
3- Styling the top bar;
4-Getting the right image in each one of its corresponding section;
5-Styling the images;
6-Getting the titles in each one of the sections;
7-Styling the titles;
8- Getting the non interactible buttons "custom order" and "existing inventory" in each section;
9-Styling the buttons created;

What I felt I must work on after this project:
-CSS skills;
